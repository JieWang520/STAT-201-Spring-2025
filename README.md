This repo holds the files and notes that we use in our class. 

I am still learning how to do things in git and github. There are things or lables or messages in Github that don't make sense. 
However, the lecture related stuff is okay except some typos. 

If you find anything that is incorrect or need immediate attention, please feel free to let me know. 

Thank you all for your interest and for your patience!
